  <p> Here are some samples from the book. Samples that I believe, will give you
    an unerstanding of just how powerful and important this book really is.

 <!--Samples-->
 <div id="sample1" class="sample">
   <p>  "Hey, it's Hannah. Hannah Baker. That's right. Don't adjust your...whatever
       device you're hearing this on. It's me, live and in stereo. No return
       engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests. Get a snack.
       Settle in. Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More
       specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to this tape you're
       one of the reasons why. I'm not saying which tape brings you into the story.
       But fear not, if you received this lovely little box, your name will pop up.
       I promise." </p>

   <div id="sample2" class="sample">
     <p>  “A lot of you cared, just not enough.” </p>
   </div>
   <div id="sample3" class="sample">
     <p> “I'm listening to someone give up. Someone I knew—someone I liked.
       I'm listening... but still, I'm too late.”  </p>
   </div>
   <div id="sample4" class="sample">
     <p>  “Because I've heard so many stories that I don't know which one is
       the most popular. But I do know which is the least popular. The truth.”   </p>
