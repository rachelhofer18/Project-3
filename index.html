     <p> "Bullying is NEVER ok. This book always reminds me to think twice
       before I make a decision and never be afraid to stand up. Thank you for
       making this book. This book is a must read!" -Unknown</p>

   <div id="review2" class="review">
     <p> "I really liked Thirteen Reasons Why. I think itâ€™s a story that needed
       to be told. It goes to show that words and/or actions can hurt people.
       Between the dual narrative of Hannah and Clay, I could really feel their
       pain. This is definitely a story that will live on for years to come."
