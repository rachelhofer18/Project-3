## Project 3 Readme
### 1. I would like to do a book showcase
### 2. I will do a site for the book 13 Reasons Why by Jay Asher. For my writing sample, I'm thinking about doing the way first page:
#### Hey, it's Hannah. Hannah Baker. That's right. Don't adjust your...whatever device you're hearing this on. It's me, live and in stereo. No return engagements, no encore, and this time, absolutely no requests. Get a snack. Settle in. Because I'm about to tell you the story of my life. More specifically, why my life ended. And if you're listening to this tape you're one of the reasons why. I'm not saying which tape brings you into the story. But fear not, if you received this lovely little box, your name will pop up. I promise.
### 3. On the [book's website](http://www.thirteenreasonswhy.com/jayasher.html) there is a short page dedicated to Jay Asher that I will probably cite.
### 4. The color pallette I am thinking of is as follows:
### 5. Then I will probably create a mood board or a collage that represents the dark essence of the book.
